## Some useful notes on LaTeX
Here I have compiled a couple of links you might find useful: 

- a really nice intro to LaTeX tutorial: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1) (I also have the pdf of the first part of this exercise in this folder.)
- a quick(er) pdf intro: https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~hongwei/group/miscl/LaTEX-shortIntro.pdf 

For the advanced (WYSIWYG editors for more complex things like TikZ)
- https://www.mathcha.io/ for TikZ editing/drawing
- https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ for making more ``advanced'' tables (you can also import csvs etc)
