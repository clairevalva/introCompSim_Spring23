## Here I will just put some matlab resources that you may find useful

- A very bare bones, but instructive overview on writing code that you can debug *relatively* easily: https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/appm2460worksheet4_2.pdf 
- Two (slightly different) matlab ``cheat-sheets'' (I prefer the first one): [here](https://n.ethz.ch/~marcokre/download/ML-CheatSheet.pdf) or [here.](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47533-cheatsheet-pdf)
- A video on using the matlab debugger: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s997-introduction-to-matlab-programming-fall-2011/resources/lecture-6-debugging/
